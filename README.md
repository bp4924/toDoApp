# toDoApp

Functionality

Add new item in text box. Click 'Add' button to add to the list

Click item to select

Click 'x' to delete that item

Things I learned:

the difference beween state and class selectors in css and why it's important

how to create an Enter/NumpadEnter event listener 

use == or === in an if. = will reassign the value of the tested item

general flow of elements, methods, properties, etc.

classList, className, toggle and how they work with the DOM

Playing now with the git interface within VS Code
